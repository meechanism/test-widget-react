# LR SDK Integration with React

This is a simple Create React App site that integrates the Live Receipts FB SDK
into a page. The only requirements are:

- Loading the script into the DOM
- Adding a container for the widget into the render method
- Listening to when the script is loaded and initializing it after it is loaded
